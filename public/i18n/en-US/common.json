We have exposed and defeated the #QFD and our test results have been used as evidence in several law suits. Just recently, we have furthermore identified a new shadowbanning method: [url=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TimelineTerminationBan&src=typed_query\"]#TimelineTerminationBan[/url]. We have outlined it in our [url=https://blog.shadowban.eu/#2019-10-16-here-we-go-again]blog[/url] and a new test is in development.[/p][p]This then, however, requires a whole new approach of testing, which would definetly bring the current setup to its knees.[/p][p]So if you feel that shadowban.eu brings you any value, please consider making a donation to our PayPal![br]Every bit helps keeping the site running and continuing our research.[/p][h6]Thank You! :)[/h6]",
